need to create a OAuth 2.0 credentials.json file at:

https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=graphql-data-importer

save that file in the root folder here. 

When the script is run, it will present a URL to create a token.json file that will be used for authentication.
Paste that URL into a browser, follow the prompts to give access using a google account.
Then paste the "code" [see in the returned URL] back into the terminal.


Adjust start date and end date in index.js addSpreadsheetRows to determine the range of rows imported to the sheet.
